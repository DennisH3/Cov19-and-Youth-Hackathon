Mental well being
Encourage schools to implement structural solutions that support student behaviour (e.g., put lines to mark where students can/cannot go) 

Initiatives to decrease fears among school staff of the risks of COVID and the efficacy of prevention measures","Economic well being
All schools in neighbourhoods with low SES have breakfast and lunch program that is free

Provide afterschool programs within each school for parents who have to work past school closure time- this will provide child care for parents while minimizing exposure to an increased number of people (as opposed to going to a babysitters house or a child care centre with other children who are not your classmates)






Physical well being
Consider allowing school closures to be a regional decision as opposed to a provincial/territorial one. The decision can be made with input from students, schools administrators, teachers, guidance from provincial and federal health authoraties, with ultimate authority landing with municipality health officials. This will allow regional leaders to assess disease transmission rates, local hospital capacity, and other factors at a local level. 

Encourage play

Canadian families can be active role models and provide the kind of positive encouragement our kids need. Start by identifying as an active family.
Recommendations: 
Be an active role model

Create a family media plan that includes screen-free times

Encourage more outdoor time (participaction)

Parents perceived capacity that they can limit their child’s screen time and increase their child’s physical activity during COVID is the number one predictor to help children meet movement behaviour expectations- Recommended that school send guidance to parents around this to build perceived capacity (Guererro et al., 2020)




Mental well being
Include a specific focus on children’s mental well-being and recovery in the school curriculum. See Denmark for an example. The Disaster Relief Sector also has many tools for psycho-social support during disasters."
