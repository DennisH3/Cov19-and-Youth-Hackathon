School closures, while useful to prevent transmission in schools, added little to the effects of partial community closures and were not effective on their own to reduce the overall attack rate and control the epidemic, particularly if community transmission — driven by individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic but infectious — persists. Without additional public health measures, school closures will only delay an epidemic. Our findings are consistent with early studies that suggest closing schools may not be as effective as other less restrictive measures. Workplace and general community closures were shown to be much more effective, because transmission is occurring predominantly in these settings. (Globe & Mail: School Shutdowns Have Put Children up to Eight Months behind in Reading, Research Indicates)

Access to publicly funded meal programs- increases likelihood that food insecure children have access to 1-2 meals a day

Play at recess (also important for mental well-being)

Regularly scheduled physical activity through DPA (daily physical activity breaks) and gym classes

Access to nutrition programs - food security, learning about healthy eating

More likely to have a regular sleep schedule than during the pandemic

Reduced screen time

Most kids rate their quality of life positively (70% as good/very good) but there are about 1 in 5 who rate it poorly. Notably, those born outside of Canada and those living in Quebec are less positive. (Abacus and Children First Poll- Nov 2020)

Parents report that 40% of kids were happy to go back to school in the fall (Children First Canada Abacus COVID poll, Oct 2020)

Children have a regular/predictable routine, which is very important for their sense of security and well-being

Reduced caregiver stress, which lowers family conflict and improves the ability of caregivers to parent effectively

Increased social connection with peers and caring adults

Increased engagement in meaningful activity (sense of purpose and hope)

Physical well being
Consider allowing school closures to be a regional decision as opposed to a provincial/territorial one. The decision can be made with input from students, schools administrators, teachers, guidance from provincial and federal health authoraties, with ultimate authority landing with municipality health officials. This will allow regional leaders to assess disease transmission rates, local hospital capacity, and other factors at a local level.

Do we have any research/evidence on best practices? http://laurelsprings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Best_Practices_for_Teaching_Online_Laurel_Springs_School.pdf","Lia’s note: Other than for children who are immunocompromised or live with someone who is immunocompromised, I see no pros to virtual learning for children. The primary pro is for society in that closing schools may help to reduce community spread (mainly by keeping more adults home). The impact of school closures on community spread doesn’t even appear to be that significant. It’s more a measure that gives the appearance that governments are doing something, while not having to do things that are more effective but less popular. That is, school closures seem to be “policy theatre” just like some of the excessive cleaning is considered “hygiene theatre.” (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/world/france-has-kept-schools-open-without-driving-up-infections-and-other-news-from-around-the-world.html)

Economic well being
Unexpected child care needs (and costs) will not arise due to things like need for COVID testing or cold/flu/COVID symptoms





Physical well being
School closures may not be as effective as other less restrictive measures due to lower transmission rates in schools (as compared to the community and workplace). That being said, there would be zero transmission within schools if they were closed and virtual learning was the only option (Globe & Mail: School Shutdowns Have Put Children up to Eight Months behind in Reading, Research Indicates)

Same study indicates that transmission rates increase within families when children are in school- virtual learning will mean less transmission within families, especially to those who are elderly or immunocompromised. 




Mental well being
Parents who had their children learning remotely were less worried about COVID 19 overall than parents who had their children in in-class learning (ChildrenFirstCanada Abacus COVID poll, 2020).

Young children require support and supervision to do online learning. This includes support to use technology, read and type, as well as to focus and participate. Parents/caregivers cannot work and support online learning. 

Women are more likely to be forced out of the workforce to support online learning.

Impact on health sector and education sector with women leaving the workforce. (i.e., how do you teach your class, while also supporting your child to participate in their class?)

Individual family approaches to online learning contribute to educational inequities (e.g., some families can hire teachers, others can provide no support) which will impact children’s long-term educational outcomes and future productivity. (***CBC had a number of experts of OISE speaking about this. Might have been on the Current?)

Many families do not have the technology and connectivity to have multiple students doing online learning, and also work from home themselves.

indicators of child abuse may go unnoticed by trusted adults like teachers

Education quality
Relationship/connection is an essential element for student learning. This is harder to foster and maintain in online learning. 

Learning gaps grew in the initial phase of remote learning, which has the potential to impact student success and education outcomes. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-school-shutdowns-have-put-children-up-to-eight-months-behind-in/ 

The youngest of students need to learn social and emotional skills as well as academic building blocks (i.e., reading and writing). These skills are not easily built online. Social and emotional skills are learned through interactions with other people. 

School system relied on parents/caregivers to support young students with remote learning. Parents/caregivers do not have the skills to do this. In many cases, students were resistant to their parent/caregiver taking on this role.","Economic well being
