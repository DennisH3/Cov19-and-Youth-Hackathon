Parents/Adults can spend more time doing work (previously doing child care)

Parents do not have to pay for child care (or pay for fewer hours of child care) when children are in school full time

Long-term impact on children’s school engagement, completion, and future economic productivity


Physical well being
School closures, while useful to prevent transmission in schools, added little to the effects of partial community closures and were not effective on their own to reduce the overall attack rate and control the epidemic, particularly if community transmission — driven by individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic but infectious — persists. 

Access to publicly funded meal programs- increases likelihood that food insecure children have access to 1-2 meals a day

Play at recess (also important for mental well-being)

Regularly scheduled physical activity through DPA (daily physical activity breaks) and gym classes

Impact on education and health system of parents needing to isolate/care for isolating children, as these sectors have high numbers of women employees

A recent study on the potential impact of the pandemic on youth education in Canada highlighted that the adverse effect might increase the socioeconomic skills gap by as much as 30% (UNICEF report)

Women leaving the workforce or not able to re-enter the workforce, due to the unpredictability of school absences and closures. https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-she-cession-is-real-and-a-problem-for-everyone (Armine Yalnizyan - might have data)

Inconsistent access to publicly funded food programs which may mean low income families are spending more on food or unable to afford food and children are eating less

This set up is not manageable for many working families with young children. It puts pressures on women to leave the workforce

Parents of young children unable to work when children need to test or isolate, affecting their job security

A recent study on the potential impact of the pandemic on youth education in Canada highlighted that the adverse effect might increase the socioeconomic skills gap by as much as 30% (UNICEF report)

Distance learning requires Internet access, and while the 2018 Canadian Internet Use Survey found that 94% of Canadians had home Internet access, there nonetheless exist inequities in the ability of school children to actively participate in online education. 

Parents may be required to reduce or leave work in order to stay home with children learning virtually

Needing child care on days children are not in school may be challenging during COVID

"Virtual only model
Include best practices

Considerations:
Seperate by asynchronous and synchronous. Ontario teachers’ unions pushed for asynchronous. Parents and students wanted synchronous.

Do we have any research/evidence on best practices? http://laurelsprings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Best_Practices_for_Teaching_Online_Laurel_Springs_School.pdf","Economic well being
Unexpected child care needs (and costs) will not arise due to things like need for COVID testing or cold/flu/COVID symptoms


Physical well being
School closures may not be as effective as other less restrictive measures due to lower transmission rates in schools (as compared to the community and workplace). That being said, there would be zero transmission within schools if they were closed and virtual learning was the only option (Globe & Mail: School Shutdowns Have Put Children up to Eight Months behind in Reading, Research Indicates)

Same study indicates that transmission rates increase within families when children are in school- virtual learning will mean less transmission within families, especially to those who are elderly or immunocompromised. 




Mental well being
Parents who had their children learning remotely were less worried about COVID 19 overall than parents who had their children in in-class learning (ChildrenFirstCanada Abacus COVID poll, 2020). Parents whose children were in learnings pods were the least worried of all parents, even then compared to those whose children were not in school.

Decreased risk of exposure to COVID and exposure to immediate family members 

Youth are more concerned about family member contracting COVID than getting it themselves (UNICEF)

Moderate use of digital technology tends to be positive for children and youth’s mental well-being, while no use or too much use can have a small negative impact (UNICEF)","Economic well being
No access to school funded food programs for children. Low income families may be spending more on food or not have enough money to provide food. Also may mean increased reliance on public services like soup kitchens or food bank.

15% of Canadians indicated living in a household where they experienced food insecurity in the past 30 days. (Statistics Canada)

This is an increase from 2017/2018 when 8.7% of Canadianss reported food insecurity (Statistics Canada)

Young children require support and supervision to do online learning. This includes support to use technology, read and type, as well as to focus and participate. Parents/caregivers cannot work and support online learning. 

Women are more likely to be forced out of the workforce to support online learning.

Impact on health sector and education sector with women leaving the workforce. (i.e., how do you teach your class, while also supporting your child to participate in their class?)

Individual family approaches to online learning contribute to educational inequities (e.g., some families can hire teachers, others can provide no support) which will impact children’s long-term educational outcomes and future productivity. Many families do not have the technology and connectivity to have multiple students doing online learning, and also work from home themselves. 

39% of parents across Canada said they had to help kids with schoolwork and learn more than they usually do (data available from 7 provinces) (ChildrenFirstCanada Abacus COVID poll)

Children being at home may impact parent(s) ability to earn income. Specially concerning as income is the primary social determinant of health indicator. From a tax payer perspective, having less people receiving income will take a negative toll on health and mental health which will increase tax payer health spending 
Concern that many jobs cannot be done from home
 16% of parents have had to miss work because their child was unable to go to school (this is nearly 960,000 parents) (Children First Canada Abacus Back to School Poll during COVID, October 8, 2020).

 10% have had to quit or change where they work because of childcare or school challenges, and 10% have had to take extended leave because of these challenges (Children First Canada Abacus Back to School Poll during COVID, October 8, 2020).

 Each province and territory regulates its own child care sector, with some regions almost entirely shut down and others open either for essential workers or the population at large (see Friendly, Forer, Vickerson, & Mohamed, 2020). (stats can crowdsourcing)

Minimal child care options for essential workers

Availability of childcare varies and may not be available in all communities. Last minute child care may be challenging to find 

Distance learning requires Internet access, and while the 2018 Canadian Internet Use Survey found that 94% of Canadians had home Internet access, there nonetheless exist inequities in the ability of school children to actively participate in online education. 

Concerns around affordability have likely increased during COVID as unemployment rates have risen.

School closures, while useful to prevent transmission in schools, added little to the effects of partial community closures and were not effective on their own to reduce the overall attack rate and control the epidemic, particularly if community transmission — driven by individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic but infectious — persists. 

Increased reliance on public services like food banks or soup kitchens means increased exposure to others. Also means children may attend with parents and have increased exposure or may be left alone in home which increases risk of preventable injuries

62% Recent research shows that during the COVID-19 outbreak, parents reported that 62% of children were less physically active outdoors (participaction)

Increased time on screensOnline learning increases sedentary time for children. 

Children may be less physically active without other children to play with, playground/sports equipment, and planned DPA.

Children with special needs lost access to services and supports essential to their functioning and development. 

Healthy daily routines are harder to maintain (e.g., regular eating and sleeping times)



Mental well being
Social isolation 

Frontline agencies such as Kids Help Phone have seen a significant increase in children and youth accessing their services. 

indicators of child abuse may go unnoticed by trusted adults like teachers

Developmental concerns with virtual learning - virtual learning may require more self directed learning and asynchronous learning- this is developmentally inappropriate during childhood

Lost opportunities for play (not only important for kids’ well-being but also one of their rights)

Reduced opportunities to develop caring relationships with adults outside their household 

Reduced opportunities to develop informal peer relationships

Increased stress and conflict within families 

Increased parental/caregiver mental distress and substance use

Internet and digital technology, while providing a positive source of help and a sense of inclusion, can also open up possibilities of cyber-bullying, impact mental health and exacerbate sleeping problems (UNICEF)


Education quality
Relationship/connection is an essential element for student learning. This is harder to foster and maintain in online learning. 

Learning gaps grew in the initial phase of remote learning, which has the potential to impact student success and education outcomes. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-school-shutdowns-have-put-children-up-to-eight-months-behind-in/ 

The youngest of students need to learn social and emotional skills as well as academic building blocks (i.e., reading and writing). These skills are not easily built online. Social and emotional skills are learned through interactions with other people. 

School system relied on parents/caregivers to support young students with remote learning. Parents/caregivers do not have the skills to do this. In many cases, students were resistant to their parent/caregiver taking on this role."
